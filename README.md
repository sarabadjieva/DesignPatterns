# DesignPatterns

Study materials, gathered during the [C# Design Patterns Course](www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-csharp-dotnet).<br>
The code and the architecture are a <i>little</i> bit different than the course's.<br>
I have also added some notes, but these files alone could <b>not</b> teach Design Patterns.
