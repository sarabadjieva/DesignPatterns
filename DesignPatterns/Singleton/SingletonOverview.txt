Motivation
- For some components it only makes sense to have one in the system
	-ex: Database repository, Object factory
- Where the construction call is expensive
	- We only do it once
	- We provide everyone with the same instance
- Want to prevent anyone creating additional copies
- Need to take care of lazy instantiation and thread safety
